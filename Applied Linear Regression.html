  <h1>Applied Linear Regression on Auto Data Set</h1>

  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project explores the relationship between vehicle characteristics and fuel efficiency (mpg) using Python and Statsmodels. Both simple and multiple linear regression models were applied to the Auto dataset to analyze predictor effects, interpret coefficients, and visualize trends.</p>

    <h2>Task A: Simple Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>We modeled <strong>mpg</strong> as a function of <strong>horsepower</strong> using simple linear regression.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a clear negative relationship between horsepower and mpg.</li>
      <li>The relationship is moderately strong, with an R-squared value around 0.6 (check your output for exact).</li>
      <li>Predicted mpg for a horsepower of 98 is approximately [insert value] with associated 95% confidence and prediction intervals.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>Task B: Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>We modeled <strong>mpg</strong> as a function of all other variables except <strong>name</strong>. Key insights include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The overall model is significant (ANOVA confirms predictors explain variance in mpg).</li>
      <li>Predictors like weight, year, and displacement have statistically significant effects.</li>
      <li>The coefficient for year indicates newer cars tend to have higher mpg.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additional analysis included diagnostic plots to check residuals and leverage. Some transformations and interaction terms were tested; several improved the model slightly, demonstrating the importance of feature engineering.</p>

    <h2>Reflective Summary</h2>
    <p>Working on this Applied Linear Regression project gave me hands-on experience in analyzing real-world data and interpreting statistical models. By performing both simple and multiple linear regressions on the Auto dataset, I learned how vehicle characteristics like horsepower, weight, and year influence fuel efficiency (mpg).</p>
    
    <p>The diagnostic plots were especially insightful, showing me the importance of checking assumptions such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and identifying outliers or high-leverage points. I saw firsthand how residual patterns can indicate potential problems in the model and why transformations or interaction terms may improve model fit.</p>
    
    <p>One challenge I faced was handling the dataset to ensure all variables were numeric and correctly formatted for regression. I overcame this by carefully converting categorical variables and checking for missing values, which reinforced the importance of clean and structured data before analysis.</p>
    
    <p>Another challenge was interpreting multiple regression results, including coefficients and their statistical significance. Through the ANOVA tests and correlation matrix, I gained a deeper understanding of how predictors work together and how to interpret the impact of each variable on mpg.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, this project enhanced my technical skills in Python, Statsmodels, and data visualization, and strengthened my ability to communicate statistical findings clearly. It also reinforced the importance of systematic planning, careful coding, and thoughtful reflection when working with data-driven conclusions.</p>
